## Who am I?

### Most general answer

I am some sort of weird, self-referential pattern on a speck of order within an ocean of constantly growing chaos. One of many characteristics of the pattern is transforming chaos into structure. One such structure is this blog.

### More specific answer

I'm some guy who has a problem of over-thinking things, especially life. I hope that this bug is actually a feature and sometimes use it to write things.

## Why you'd want to go on a date with me?

Because you are a curious pattern and you like company of curious patterns.

## What am I trying to do here?

I'm trying to figure out my trajectory through space-time. Doing it is a characteristic of the kind of pattern I am. There is a lot going on in my head and I need to let it go somewhere somehow. This blog is a tool to achieve that. I'm not an expert on the things I write about. Except for emptying my head, writing things down has following advantages:

- it's easier to evaluate ideas that are written down rather then in one's head,
- one can get criticism.

### Some other framing

I want to figure out what to do with my life. I have lots of different thoughts. I decided to write them down. Maybe somebody will find them useful so I publish them here.
